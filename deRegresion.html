					<p style="font-size:20px ;text-align:justify">Regression problems are those in which the output
						variable takes a continuous value. <br>
						Most used regression algorithms are: <br>

					<p style="font-size:24px ;color:Tomato;"> LINEAR REGRESSION </p>
					<p style="font-size:18px ;text-align:justify">It is a linear model, which assumes a linear
						relationship between the input variables and the output variable <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y" border="0"/>. <br>
						
						The linear regression equation assigns a scale factor to each input attribute, called a
						coefficient and usually represented by the letter Î². An additional coefficient is added, giving
						a greater degree of freedom usually called the intercept or the bias coefficient. It is common
						to talk about the complexity of the linear regression model referring to the number of
						coefficients. <br>
						Learning a linear regression model applies estimating the values of the coefficients used in the
						representation of the information. <br> <br>
						<strong> DATA PREPARATION: </strong> <br>
						Assumption of linear relationship: it may be necessary to transform data to make the relationship between input and output linear. <br>
						Noise and collinearity must be removed <br>
						Gaussian distribution: predictions will be more reliable if the distribution is Gaussian
						(normal). <br>
						Normalization: predictions will be more reliable if normalization is used. <br>
					</p>
					<p style="font-size:24px ;color:Tomato;"> DECISION TREES - CART - Classification And Regression
						Trees </p>
					<p style="font-size:18px ;text-align:justify">They have been classically referred to as decision
						trees although currently they are called Classification and Regression Trees (CART) <br>

						The representation is a binary tree where each node represents an input variable <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x" /> and a cut-off
						point in said variable. The leaves of the tree contain the output variable <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y"/> that are used to
						make the prediction. <br>
						Making predictions is pretty straightforward.
						Each input variable can be thought of as a dimension in p-dimensional space.
						The decision tree divides the space into two rectangles or hyper-rectangles with more entries.
						<br>
						An avid method is used to divide the space called binary recursive division.
						It is a numerical procedure where all values are aligned and different division points are
						tested using a cost function.
						The division with the best cost is selected. <br>
						For regression problems the cost function that is minimized to select the cut-off points is the
						sum of the squared errors of all the training samples. <br>
						The most common stopping procedure is to use the minimum amount of training data used for each
						leaf node. <br>
						The tree can be pruned after training since simpler trees are preferred since they are easier to
						understand and less likely to overfit information. <br>
						The quickest and simplest pruning methods are carried out by evaluating the effect on the cost
						of removing said node from the model.
						When improvements are not achieved, the procedure is stopped. <br> <br>
						<strong> DATA PREPARATION: </strong> <br>
						No preparation required. <br>



					<p style="font-size:24px ;color:Tomato;">RANDOM FOREST</p>
					<p style="font-size:18px ;text-align:justify"> They are an improvement over decision trees that use
						the Bagged (Bagging and Aggregation) algorithm.
						Is an avid algorithm, this implies that in each iteration it looks for the local optimum that
						may end up not being the optimum at a general level.
						In each split, a number of attributes established by parameter are evaluated that are randomly
						selected from among all the available attributes,
						It is recommended for regression algorithms that this number be equal to p / 3, where p is the
						number of variables or input attributes. <br>
						Random Forest solves the problem of correlation between models by including randomness in their
						elaboration.
						To decide the number m of attributes to select, it is better to start with 5 values between 2
						and p (number of attributes or input variables) and go testing the performance, for the number
						of models to run.
						An approximate 1000 trees is recommended, although as in all cases it depends on the problem and
						knowledge of the business. for
						In random forest all trees are created independently to have the desired depth and contribute in
						the same way to the model. <br>

					<p style="font-size:24px ;color:Tomato;"> GRADIENT BOOST FOR REGRESSION TREES
					<p style="font-size:18px ;text-align:justify">
						Given a loss measurement function and a weak learning algorithm, an additive model is found that
						minimizes the loss function. <br>
						It starts with the average of the responses, the gradient is calculated and the model is adapted
						to the residuals to minimize the loss function.
						The model is added to the previous one and the procedure continues as many times as stipulated
						in the parameter that is established by the researcher. <br>

						Advantages of using trees is that they can become weak models by controlling the depth of the
						tree, in turn, they can be separated, maintaining independence and can be generated quickly.
