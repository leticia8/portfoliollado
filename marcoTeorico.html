					<h2> </h2>
					<p> Among the various definitions of Machine Learning that one can find when searching the internet
						are: </p>
					<p> “Machine Learning is a scientific discipline in the field of Artificial Intelligence that
						creates systems that learn automatically. Learning in this context means identifying complex
						patterns in millions of data. The machine that really learns is an algorithm that reviews the
						data and is capable of predicting future behavior. Automatically, also in this context, implies
						that these systems are improved autonomously over time, without human intervention. Let's see
						how it works. " </p>
					<p> “Machine learning is a field of computing that aims to teach computers how to learn and act
						without being explicitly programmed. More specifically, machine learning is an approach to data
						analysis that involves building and adapting models, which allow programs to "learn" through
						experience. Machine learning involves building algorithms that adapt your models to improve
						their ability to make predictions. " </p>
					<p> “Machine learning algorithms use statistics to find patterns in massive amounts of data. And the
						data, here, covers a lot of things: numbers, words, images, clicks, whatever you have. If it can
						be stored digitally, it can be fed into a machine learning algorithm. Machine learning is the
						process that drives many of the services we use today: recommendation systems like Netflix,
						YouTube, and Spotify; search engines like Google and Baidu; feeds from social networks such as
						Facebook and Twitter; Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. " </p>
					<h2> Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence </h2>
					<p> Machine learning is an area or branch of artificial intelligence, since machine learning
						algorithms serve as a tool to carry out artificial intelligence processes.
					<h2> Machine learning and statistical analysis </h2>


					<p> Regarding statistical analysis, the fields of action of both disciplines are complementary, even
						the models used in Machine Learning algorithms are statistical models. In turn, machine learning
						algorithms enhance any statistical analysis by automating processes that otherwise would not be
						viable or would be tedious, such as finding causal relationships between variables and their
						correlations as well as inferring possible hidden relationships. </p>
					<h2> Machine learning and data mining </h2>
					<p> Machine learning uses data mining techniques as well as statistics to explore underlying
						patterns and build models on the data link, data mining extracts rules from the data while
						machine learning is responsible for generating an automatic process to the learning of these
						rules and the construction of models that allow to explain and / or predict the behavior of the
						data and the causal relationships between variables. </p>
					<h2> Machine learning applications </h2>
					<p> Machine learning applications are transversal to all areas of knowledge, there are undoubtedly
						more sensitive areas such as security (both at the level of data protection and fraud analysis)
						and the financial field where the implementation of fast and Efficient means a qualitative leap
						because delays in decision-making and information analysis cannot be allowed. Other relevant
						areas are marketing, insurance, the health field as well as natural language processing areas
						and some advances within the Internet of Things area such as smart cars, among others. </p>
					<h2> CRISP - DM </h2>


					<p>CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) synthesizes the life cycle of a data
						analysis project, dividing it into six main phases that are not rigid but allow progress back
						and forth as needs dictate.
						The 6 phases of the process are:
					<p> 1. Business Understanding. Definition of customer needs </p>
					<p> 2. Data Understanding: Familiarization with the data to know them, identifying quality problems
						and making hypotheses of possible correlations. </p>
					<p> 3. Preparation of the data: selection of tables, attributes, transformation and cleaning of
						data, treatment of missing. </p>
					<p> 4. Modeling: selection of modeling techniques and parameter setting. </p>
					<p> 5. Evaluation of the model, the steps followed to create it and how well it adapts to the
						business are reviewed. </p>
					<p> 6. Implementation implies the organization of the information, its presentation and disposition
						to be able to transmit it to the client. </p>
					<p> This process is still used but it is also criticized that it is a designed process; it has lost
						its validity many years ago, instead more agile processes arise that seek feedback as they
						advance through the stages, this This is the case of Team Data Science Process, it is a dynamic
						model that is based on four stages: Understanding the business, Acquisition and understanding of
						the data, Modeling, Implementation, some include a fifth stage that would require customer
						acceptance. It is oriented to team and collaborative work. </p>
					<p> Analogous processes are KDD acronym for Knowledge Discovery in Databases:


						It consists of five stages
					<p> Selection: create an objective data set or focus on a subset of variables or information
						samples. </p>
					<p> Pre-processing: cleaning the data to make it consistent </p>
					<p> Transformation: data transformation using reduction or transformation </p>
					<p> Data Mining: look for patterns of interest depending on the objectives being sought. </p>
					<p> Interpretation / Evaluation: interpretation and evaluation of the patterns obtained. </p>
					SEMMA - Powered by the SAS Institute and acronym for Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess
					consists of five stages:
					Sample, selection of data, which must be large enough to obtain the information needed and small
					enough to be used efficiently.
					Exploration, covers the understanding of the data, discovering relationships between variables as
					well as any abnormalities.
					Modification - Contains methods for selecting, creating, and transforming variables to prepare for
					data modeling
					Modeling: in this phase the focus is on applying various modeling techniques on the prepared
					variables to create desired models.
					Evaluation: last phase in which the model is evaluated and the utility and reliability of the model
					are shown.
					KDD and SEMMA can be seen as analogous processes with equivalent stages, while CRISP-DM incorporates
					previous and subsequent steps of the previous processes, such as knowledge of the business and its
					implementation. </p>
